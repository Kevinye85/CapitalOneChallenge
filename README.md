# CapitalOneChallenge

A quick and easy-to-use website that gives you the name of a random NBA Player, and the position they play. 

Deployed Website: https://kevinye85.github.io/CapitalOneChallenge/

# My Solution

For this Challenge,  I utilized HTML and CSS to create and design a website that combines my love for basketball with this project. This project allowed me to remember all the players that I watched growing up and to learn about new players. I am currently using GitHub pages to host my website.
